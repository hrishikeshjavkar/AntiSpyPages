        <p>By downloading or using the Javz app (the “Application”), these terms will automatically apply to you – please read them carefully before using the Application.</p>

        <p>You are not allowed to copy, modify, or reverse engineer the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks in any way. You are also not permitted to attempt to extract the source code of the Application, translate it into other languages, or create derivative works. All trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of Hrishikesh Javkar.</p>

        <p>We are committed to ensuring that the Application is as useful and efficient as possible. We reserve the right to make changes to the Application or to charge for its features, at any time and for any reason. We will always make it clear when any fees or subscriptions apply.</p>

        <p>The Application may offer in-app purchases or auto-renewable subscriptions. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account upon confirmation. Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You may manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your App Store account settings.</p>

        <p>The Application may process anonymized usage data through third-party tools (e.g., Firebase, RevenueCat) to provide analytics, crash reporting, or subscription services. It is your responsibility to keep your device and access to the Application secure. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, which could compromise your device’s security and affect app functionality.</p>

        <p>Certain features of the Application may require an internet connection. We cannot be held responsible for full functionality of the Application if you do not have access to Wi-Fi or have exceeded your mobile data allowance. If you are using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile provider’s data charges may apply, including roaming fees if applicable.</p>

        <p>We are not responsible for the way you use the Application. For example, if your device runs out of battery and you miss an important scan, we are not liable for any resulting issues.</p>

        <p>Although we aim to provide accurate and reliable functionality, the Application is offered “as is.” We rely on device sensors and do not guarantee the detection of hidden or spy cameras. You agree to use the Application responsibly and understand that we accept no liability for direct or indirect losses resulting from use or reliance on the Application.</p>

        <p>We may update the Application periodically. You may need to install the latest version to continue using it. We do not guarantee ongoing support for outdated versions. We may also discontinue the Application at any time, with or without notice. Upon termination, you must stop using the Application and delete it from your device.</p>

        <p>The Service Provider expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Use of the Application is at your own risk, and the Service Provider shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the Application.</p>
